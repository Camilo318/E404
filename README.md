## Challenge from devchallenges.io

The page is responsive 
* TailwindCSS was used 😁
* Heavy use of Flexbox 
* I added a subtle animation to the message
* It has a header and main tag
* Inside the main tag we've got a div container with two divs inside
* The first div inside contains the image and the second one contains the text
